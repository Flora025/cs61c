1.jki [n = 1000, 25.814 Gflop/s], kji
2.ijk [n = 1000, 2.207 Gflop/s], jik

Checkoff Question 1: col-major, 尤其jki的内层是按列由上至下遍历的（&&只涉及到C和A） => reduced miss rate
Checkoff Question 2: 内层循环移动幅度大(ABC同时), did not take adv of spatial locality
Checkoff Question 3: “变动幅度大”的放在外层 -> reduce miss rate -> optimized cache
